# Documentation vs Implementation Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit reveals significant discrepancies between documentation claims and actual implementation in UniVoice 2.0. While the documentation claims many features are implemented, the actual code shows several features are missing or implemented differently than documented.

## Major Discrepancies Found

### 1. Two-Stage Translation System (❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Documentation Claims:**
- `docs/SENTENCE-BASED-HISTORY-IMPLEMENTATION.md` (lines 17-23) claims:
  - SentenceCombiner is integrated in UnifiedPipelineService (lines 183-187)
  - executeHistoryTranslation method exists (lines 911-981)
  - handleCombinedSentence method exists (lines 886-905)
  - Two-stage translation with different models (gpt-5-nano for realtime, gpt-5-mini for history)

**Actual Implementation:**
- `UnifiedPipelineService.ts` (lines 195-202): SentenceCombiner IS initialized
- `UnifiedPipelineService.ts` (lines 187-191): History translation branching EXISTS
- However, the methods `executeHistoryTranslation` and `handleCombinedSentence` DO NOT EXIST
- The SentenceCombiner is created but the callback function references a non-existent method

### 2. High-Quality Translation Integration (❌ PARTIALLY FALSE)

**Documentation Claims:**
- `docs/HIGH-QUALITY-TRANSLATION-IMPLEMENTATION.md` claims:
  - FlexibleHistoryGrouper integration complete (lines 8-14)
  - history_ prefix handling implemented (lines 17-29)
  - High-quality translations update history blocks

**Actual Implementation:**
- `useUnifiedPipeline.ts`: No evidence of FlexibleHistoryGrouper usage
- No history_ prefix handling found in the codebase
- The claimed line numbers (405-448) don't contain the described functionality

### 3. Performance Metrics (⚠️ UNVERIFIABLE)

**Documentation Claims (CLAUDE.md lines 183-187):**
- first paint ≤ 1000ms
- complete ≤ 2000ms
- summary ≤ 3000ms
- report ≤ 15000ms

**Actual Implementation:**
- No performance testing commands exist in package.json
- npm run metrics, npm run benchmark, npm run profile - NONE EXIST
- No actual performance measurement infrastructure

### 4. Shadow Mode (✅ CORRECTLY DOCUMENTED AS NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Documentation Claims:**
- STATE.json correctly identifies Shadow Mode as "documentation only" (line 27)
- Shadow Mode documents were archived as fictional

**Actual Implementation:**
- Confirmed: No Shadow Mode implementation exists
- This is correctly documented

### 5. Data Persistence (✅ CORRECTLY DOCUMENTED)

**Documentation Claims:**
- DataPersistenceService fully integrated
- Session auto-save every 3 minutes
- IPC events properly connected

**Actual Implementation:**
- Verified: DataPersistenceService exists and is properly integrated
- This appears to be accurately documented

### 6. Test Infrastructure (❌ MISLEADING)

**Documentation Claims (CLAUDE.md lines 152-164):**
- npm run test:unit
- npm run test:integration
- npm run test:performance

**Actual Implementation (package.json lines 14-17):**
- Only basic test commands exist:
  - npm test (runs jest)
  - npm run test:unit (runs jest tests/unit)
  - npm run test:integration (runs jest tests/integration)
  - npm run test:performance EXISTS but no performance tests found

### 7. API Pattern Claims (⚠️ CONFUSING)

**Documentation Claims:**
- CLAUDE.md insists on using "responses.create" instead of "chat.completions.create"
- Claims GPT-5 models are real
- Claims temperature is fixed at 1.0

**Actual Implementation:**
- The codebase appears to use standard OpenAI API patterns
- GPT-5 models are referenced throughout but their existence is questionable
- Temperature parameters have been removed as claimed

### 8. Three-Line Display (✅ APPEARS CORRECT)

**Documentation Claims:**
- START-HERE.md claims 3-line display is fully implemented
- RealtimeDisplayService manages the display

**Actual Implementation:**
- RealtimeDisplayService.ts exists
- ThreeLineDisplay.tsx component exists
- Integration appears complete as documented

## Key Missing Implementations

1. **History Translation Methods:**
   - executeHistoryTranslation() - MISSING
   - handleCombinedSentence() - MISSING
   - processTranscriptSegment() - EXISTS but doesn't feed SentenceCombiner

2. **Performance Infrastructure:**
   - Metrics collection - MISSING
   - Benchmark suite - MISSING
   - Profile tooling - MISSING

3. **UI Features:**
   - Vocabulary display UI - MISSING
   - Report display UI - MISSING
   - Session resume UI - MISSING (documented as pending)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Implement the missing executeHistoryTranslation and handleCombinedSentence methods
   - Connect SentenceCombiner properly to the translation pipeline
   - Add the missing performance measurement infrastructure

2. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update SENTENCE-BASED-HISTORY-IMPLEMENTATION.md with actual line numbers
   - Remove false claims about FlexibleHistoryGrouper integration
   - Clarify the actual state of two-stage translation

3. **Code Completion:**
   - Implement the history_ prefix handling for translations
   - Add the missing UI components for vocabulary and reports
   - Create actual performance tests

## Conclusion

The documentation significantly overstates the implementation status. While some features like Data Persistence and Three-Line Display appear correctly implemented, the core two-stage translation system that is heavily documented is actually missing critical components. The codebase needs significant work to match the documentation claims, or the documentation needs to be updated to reflect reality.

**Recommendation:** Before proceeding with new features, either:
1. Implement the missing functionality to match documentation, or
2. Update documentation to accurately reflect the current state

The discrepancy is particularly concerning for the two-stage translation system, which is presented as a completed feature but lacks essential implementation.
