# Shadow Metrics Implementation Report

## Implementation Summary (Stage 0)

### What was implemented:

1. **Unified Event Types** (electron/shared/ipcEvents.ts)
   - Simple TypeScript interfaces (no Zod in electron process)
   - Event kinds: partial, final, translation_update, translation_complete, etc.
   - Monotonic sequence numbering
   - Unique event IDs

2. **Shadow Event Emission** (electron/main.ts)
   - `emitUnified()` function that creates unified events
   - Development-only emission to avoid production impact
   - Console logging of all shadow events
   - Added to key pipeline event handlers:
     - currentOriginalUpdate → kind: 'partial'
     - currentTranslationUpdate → kind: 'translation_update'  
     - translationComplete → kind: 'translation_complete'

3. **Preload Bridge** (electron/preload.ts)
   - Added `onUnifiedEvent` method to window.univoice API
   - Basic validation (no Zod schema yet)
   - Development-only availability

4. **Shadow Metrics Hook** (src/hooks/useUnifiedEventShadowMetrics.ts)
   - Tracks: received count, sequence violations, duplicates, latency
   - LRU cache for duplicate detection
   - Percentile calculations (P50, P95, P99)
   - Console logging every 100 events

5. **Integration** (src/components/UniVoice.tsx)
   - Hook integrated into main component
   - Metrics collected automatically when events flow

### Current Status:

✅ **TypeScript compiles successfully**
✅ **Build completes without errors**
✅ **Implementation follows Stage 0 design (shadow only)**
✅ **No changes to existing behavior**
⚠️ **Events only emit when pipeline is active (need to start a session)**

### How to Test:

1. Start the application: `npm run electron`
2. Complete the setup screen and click "授業開始"
3. Allow microphone permissions
4. Open DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab
5. Speak into the microphone to generate ASR/translation events
6. Look for:
   - `[Main] Shadow unified event:` logs in terminal
   - `[Shadow Metrics]` logs in browser console

### Next Steps (Stage 1):

1. Add Zod validation to src version
2. Enable actual unified channel emission (not just shadow)
3. Create adapters to replace legacy channels
4. Add comprehensive metrics dashboard
5. Performance testing with production workloads

### Risk Assessment:

- **Stage 0 Risk**: Zero (shadow only, no behavior changes)
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal (512 event cache + 1000 latency samples)
- **Performance Impact**: Negligible (passive observation only)

### Code Quality:

- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Development-only features properly gated
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Memory-efficient design (LRU cache)

### Conclusion:

Stage 0 implementation is complete and ready for testing. The shadow metrics system is in place but will only show activity when the pipeline is actively processing audio/translations. This provides a safe foundation for measuring the impact of IPC unification before making any behavioral changes in Stage 1.
