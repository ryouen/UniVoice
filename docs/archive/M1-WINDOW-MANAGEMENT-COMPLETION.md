# M1 Window Management Implementation - Completion Report

Date: 2025-09-14  
Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully implemented the WindowRegistry pattern for UniVoice window management, enabling independent history and summary windows with position persistence.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Window Management Architecture
- ✅ Created `WindowRegistry` class for centralized window lifecycle management
- ✅ Created `BoundsStore` class for window position/size persistence
- ✅ Implemented window role-based management (setup, main, history, summary)
- ✅ Setup window automatically resizes to content (.background element)
- ✅ Setup→Main transition reuses the same window

### 2. IPC Communication
- ✅ Added `windowManager` API to preload script
- ✅ Implemented IPC handlers in main process:
  - `window:setSetupBounds` - Resize setup window
  - `window:enterMain` - Transition from setup to main
  - `window:toggleHistory` - Show/hide history window
  - `window:toggleSummary` - Show/hide summary window
- ✅ All existing IPC channels remain unchanged (backward compatibility)

### 3. Renderer Integration
- ✅ Created `WindowClient` service as a thin wrapper
- ✅ Updated `SetupSection.tsx` with ResizeObserver for automatic sizing
- ✅ Updated `UniVoice.tsx` to use WindowClient for panel management
- ✅ Added data-testid attributes for E2E testing

### 4. Testing
- ✅ Created comprehensive E2E tests (`window-management.test.ts`)
- ✅ Created golden master tests for IPC invariance
- ✅ Added Playwright configuration for E2E testing
- ✅ All tests verify:
  - Window position restoration
  - Setup window auto-sizing
  - Independent panel windows
  - Multi-display support

### Window Behavior
1. **Setup Window**: Fixed size based on .background element
2. **Main Window**: Restores to previous user-adjusted size
3. **History/Summary**: Independent windows that hide (not close) on 'x'
4. **Position Persistence**: Saved to `%APPDATA%/univoice-2.0/window-bounds.json`

### Design Decisions
- Windows hide instead of closing to preserve state
- Bounds are debounced (500ms) to reduce file I/O
- Off-screen windows are automatically repositioned
- WindowClient provides future-proof abstraction layer

## Metrics

- **Files Changed**: 8 (6 new, 2 modified)
- **Lines of Code**: ~1200 (including tests)
- **Test Coverage**: E2E + Integration tests
- **Breaking Changes**: 0 (full backward compatibility)

## Next Steps (M2)

The foundation is now in place for UI component separation:
1. DisplaySection component (realtime display logic)
2. ControlPanel component (recording controls)
3. QuestionArea component (question input)
4. Refactor UniVoice.tsx to use these components

## Lessons Learned

1. **ResizeObserver** is perfect for responsive window sizing
2. **Window hiding vs closing** preserves user context better
3. **Debounced saves** prevent excessive file writes
4. **Golden master tests** provide confidence during refactoring

## Commands

```bash
# Install Playwright (first time only)
npm install

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run golden master tests
npm run test:integration -- golden-master-ipc

# Run all tests
npm test
```

M1 implementation is now complete and ready for production use.
