4. **Validation Added**:

   - Will throw error if unsupported language is selected

## Testing Required

1. Start the application
2. Try selecting different languages in the setup screen
3. Verify that only 10 languages appear
4. Test starting a session with Japanese source language
5. Check if Deepgram connects successfully

## Deepgram Connection Issues

The user reported that Deepgram real-time transcription is not working. After fixing the language parameter issue and limiting to supported languages, we need to investigate:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify WebSocket connection to Deepgram
3. Check if audio is being sent properly
4. Verify API key is valid
5. Check network connectivity

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with the updated language support
2. Debug why Deepgram connection is failing
3. Check console logs for specific error messages
4. Verify the audio pipeline is working correctly
